            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Building on literatures that examine why firearms are appealing and to
                whom and employing Weber’s concept of “legitimate violence”, this paper utilizes an online concealed
                carry forum to critically analyze how firearm proliferation is rationalized in the U.S. The analysis
                focuses on three specific examples of violence—the Parkland, Florida, and Philando Castile shootings,
                and stories of children who find guns and shoot themselves and/or others. This work is a critical
                examination of the social construction of “legitimate violence” that deconstructs the discourses
                embedded in the “pro-gun” notion that the answer to gun violence is more guns.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Modern Guns.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">machine gun, automatic weapon of small calibre that is capable of
                sustained rapid fire. Most machine guns are belt-fed weapons that fire from 500 to 1,000 rounds per
                minute and will continue to fire as long as the trigger is held back or until the supply of ammunition
                is exhausted. The machine gun was developed in the late 19th century and has profoundly altered the
                character of modern warfare.

                Modern machine guns are classified into three groups. The light machine gun, also called the squad
                automatic weapon, is equipped with a bipod and is operated by one soldier; it usually has a box-type
                magazine and is chambered for the small-calibre, intermediate-power ammunition fired by the assault
                rifles of its military unit. The medium machine gun, or general-purpose machine gun, is belt-fed,
                mounted on a bipod or tripod, and fires full-power rifle ammunition. Through World War II the term
                “heavy machine gun” designated a water-cooled machine gun that was belt-fed, handled by a special squad
                of several soldiers, and mounted on a tripod. Since 1945 the term has designated an automatic weapon
                firing ammunition larger than that used in ordinary combat rifles; the most widely used calibre is .50
                inch or 12.7 mm, although a Soviet heavy machine gun fired a 14.5-millimetre round..</p>
